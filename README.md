DirD Unity Editor Plugin

DirD is simple folder browsing tool supporting drag and drop to other editor window.

For example,
When you try to set a material to Mesh renderer, you would specify the mesh renderer 
and lock the inspector.
Then you find the material in project tab, and set the material to mesh renderer.

If there are a lot of mesh renderer which material should be changed, you have to
repeat locking and set. This tool reduces the inspector locking because this is special
file browser which does nothing for folders and other files.
You know Unity editor supports multiple project tabs so you might say that this tool is in vain.
If you want to specify a file then drag and drop it to a inspector slot, you will find
that this tool will reduce your manual procedure a little bit. 







DirD is based on CustomProjectView https://github.com/furkancaglayan/CustomProjectView
Customized Project View for Unity3D made with Editor Windows.
